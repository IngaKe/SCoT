SCoT (Sense Clustering over Time) is a web application to view the senses of a word and their evolvement over time. The idea is to help anyone interested in diachronic semantics visualize and compare the meanings a word had at different points in time.

The functionalities and usage are described in the [user guide](userGuide.md). If you would like to deploy SCoT yourself or keep working on it see the [installation guide](installationGuide.md) for developers for more information.

SCoT was developed over the course of the summer semester 2019 in the Master's project "Web Interfaces for Language Processing Systems" at the University of Hamburg.
I will continue to develop SCoT after the project is finished.
