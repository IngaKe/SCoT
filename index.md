SCoT (Sense Clustering over Time)
=================================

With SCoT the user can view how the senses of a word have changed over time. On this page I will provide a user guide as well as an installation guide for developer.

SCoT was developed over the course of the summer semester 2019 in the Master's project "Web Interfaces for Language Processing Systems" at the University of Hamburg.
I will continue to develop SCoT after the project is finished.
